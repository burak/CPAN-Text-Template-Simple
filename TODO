* Improve unit test coverage.
        o Increase # of tests
        o Implement placeholder tests
            - 022-monolith
            - 029-block-filter.t
* Consider re-implementing BLOCKs with filters. Make them dynamic.
* Implement variable sharing without monolith..?
        o PROCESS -> no monolith ?
            - Interpolated includes do not respect monolith though :p
            - This needs fix.
            - Add SHARE: command?
            - monolith seems to be buggy
*  ***LOW*** Consider trying PPI. Resume?
*  ***LOW*** Implement TTS plugins for major frameworks.
